# The first task in Steganographie: Augsburg International | 30 Points
Here an image called "*augsburg.jpg*" is provided.

## Solution
This is a very easy problem since you can just exchange the "*.jpg*" extension to a "*.txt*" extension. Then open the file in a text editor like notepad. The flag can
be found by just searching for "*HSA*" in the file and the flag is just hidden in the middle of the file in plaintext. Flag: **HSAINNOS{Zwetschgendatschi}**.
