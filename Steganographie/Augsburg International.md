# The first task in Steganographie: Augsburg International | 30 Points
Here an image called "*augsburg.jpg*" is provided. It looks like this:

![augsburg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118717731/220870542-e0120335-3417-4710-a7f6-8a8f774ef025.jpg)

There are artifacts in the lower half of the picture, but they don't really mean anything. It's just a hint that something is in the middle of the file.

## Solution
This is a very easy problem since you can just open the file with a text editor like notepad. The flag can be found by just searching for "*HSA*" in the file 
and the flag is just hidden in the middle of the file in plaintext. Flag: **HSAINNOS{Zwetschgendatschi}**.
