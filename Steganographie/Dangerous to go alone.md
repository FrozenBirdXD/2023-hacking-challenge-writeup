# The game in Steganographie: Dangerous to go alone | 30 Points
For this challenge we are just given a single file called *large_map.gb*. 

## Solution
Since *.gb* isn't a commonly used extension we can just google it. There are multiple things this file could be, but since the file is called a map it probably is a
Game Boy ROM File with a map you can traverse. To confirm this hypothesis we can download a [gameboy emulator](https://visualboyadvance.org/download/) and open the file
with it. Now we are on a map and can move the camera with the keys *'wasd'*. The flag is hidden in the middle of the map and looks like this:
