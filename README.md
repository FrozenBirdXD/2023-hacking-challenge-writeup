# 2023-hacking-challenge-writeup

I took part in the University of Augsburg's Hacking Challenge 2023 to improve my hacking and cybersecurity abilities. The challenge was a great opportunity to learn 
and use new strategies, and I finished 31st out of over 650 participants by solving 14 of 24 questions. You had one week to solve the tasks and it was a lot of fun. 
I recommend participating.
Additional information about the event is available [here](https://www.hs-augsburg.de/Informatik/HSA-innos/Institut/White-Hats-for-Future-2023.html).

These are writeups of the tasks I solved during the hacking challenge 2023. The problems were divided into several areas (Warm-Up, Crypto, ReverseMe, Security4Fun!, Steganographie) and to solve a problem, a flag with the format HSAINNOS{answer} has to be found and submitted [here](https://hacking-challenge.ctfd.io/challenges).
A different number of points was awarded depending on the difficulty of the task: warm-up: 10, easy: 30, medium: 50, difficult: 100.
