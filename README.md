# 2023-hacking-challenge-writeup
Here are writeups to some of the problems I managed to solve in the hacking challenge 2023. I got 31st place out of over 600 participants and managed to solve 14 of the 24 problems. To solve a problem a flag with the format HSAINNOS{answer} has to be found and submitted [here](https://hacking-challenge.ctfd.io/challenges). The challenge was organized by the university of Augsburg and it was a great opportunity to learn and apply new skills. It was a lot of fun and I recommend participating. More information about the event can be found [here](https://www.hs-augsburg.de/Informatik/HSA-innos/Institut/White-Hats-for-Future-2023.html).

The challenge was divided into several areas (Warm-Up, Crypto, ReverseMe, Security4Fun!, Steganographie) and you had one week to solve the tasks. Depending on how difficult the task was, a different amount of points were rewarded: warm up: 10, easy: 30 medium: 50, difficult: 100.
My writeups are also divided into the same areas as the problems.
